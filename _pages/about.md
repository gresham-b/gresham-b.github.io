Welcome to my academic website.

======
After what I affectionately describe as a couple of "false-starts" to my undergraduate education (i.e., I withdrew from two different universities due to financial constraints), I earned my Associate in Applied Science in Paralegal Studies. After a brief stint in the legal field, I received my bachelor's degree in Psychology from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in December 2019. I am currently a third-year Developmental Psychology PhD student in the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota.

======
My research examines the upstream causes and downstream effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), particularly those occuring within the neighborhood context.
